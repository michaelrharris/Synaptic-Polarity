Contained in this folder are the input files necessary to obtain some of the results used in this work. The file labeled “known” corresponds to the 295x295 known network of positive and negative connections used in all codes, having 1752 entries. “Connectome” is a 295x295 contact adjacency matrix for the entire space of connections, known and unknown, corresponding to 3508 entries, and “ConnectomeEdgelist” is the same data in edge list format. “X” is a 295x3 matrix comprised of each of the 295 neurons of interest and their accompanying neurotransmitters, while “Y” is a 295x42 matrix comprised of each of the neurons of interest and their accompanying receptor genes. “O” is a 3x42 matrix of neurotransmitters and receptor genes to be used in conjunction with “X” and “Y” in both the “Spatial Connectome Model” and “Network Based Prediction Cross Validation” files to produce the results of the SCM. The “Spatial Connectome Model” file produces the results of the SCM, such as the file labelled “B” in the output folder, a 295x295 matrix of predictions. The “Network Based Prediction Cross Validation” file performs a 10-fold cross validation procedure using the SCM, SL3, SPA, and SL2 methods, and produces as an output a precision rank plot of the corresponding methods like that of Figure 3, panel E in this work.
